This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in VHDL related to process sensitivity lists.  The provided VHDL code exhibits unexpected behavior due to an incomplete sensitivity list in a process.  The solution shows how to correct the process sensitivity list to resolve the issue. This is important because incorrect sensitivity lists can lead to subtle and difficult-to-debug issues in hardware designs.
